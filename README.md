## About

The **tokTales Engine** is a personal project of mine that I've been working on in my free time for the past couple of years.  
It's goal is to provide a framework for creating games and other graphical applications.

## Disclaimer

Feel free to check out the samples and start working with the code, but keep in mind the following.

> **This project is currently in alpha.**  
It will contain bugs and all APIs are subject to change.

> **It is not feature complete.**  
The core structure has been implemented but a lot of functionality is still missing.

> **It is untested.**  
None of it has been tested in the wild.

> **The documentation needs additional work.**  
Not everything has Javadoc attached and the Wiki and Readme need to be expanded.
